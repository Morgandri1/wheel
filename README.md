# Wheel

They always say "don't reinvent the wheel" — sometimes you have to.

Wheel is a per-project, per-user container that runs Claude Code / Codex agents as child processes, wired to each
other and to tables, endpoints, scripts, MCP servers, vaults and chests on a visual board.

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — the shared contract every team builds against. Read it first.
- `docs/PROTOCOL.md` — engine control plane + `wheel` CLI (SDK/Engine team)
- `docs/API.md` — api.wheel.dev (API team)
- `docs/TESTPLAN.md` — acceptance criteria (QA)
- `redteam/` — threat model and findings (ADVERSARY)

Workflow: one worktree per team under `/Users/metatron/wheel-wt/<role>`, merge to `main` after `make check`.
